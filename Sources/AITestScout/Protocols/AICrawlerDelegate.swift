/// Delegate protocol for observing and customizing AICrawler behavior
///
/// All methods are optional. Implement only the methods you need to observe or customize crawler behavior.
///
/// This protocol provides extension points for:
/// - **Observing AI decisions** - Track what the AI chooses and why
/// - **Screen discovery tracking** - Know when new screens are found
/// - **Navigation monitoring** - Observe transitions between screens
/// - **Stuck detection alerts** - React when crawler detects it's stuck
/// - **Custom integrations** - Run accessibility scans, performance tests, analytics, etc.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// class MyDelegate: AICrawlerDelegate {
///     func didDiscoverNewScreen(_ fingerprint: String, hierarchy: CompressedHierarchy) {
///         // Run accessibility scan on new screen
///         AccessibilityScanner.scan(hierarchy)
///     }
///
///     func didMakeDecision(_ decision: ExplorationDecision, hierarchy: CompressedHierarchy) {
///         // Log decision to analytics
///         Analytics.track("AI Decision", decision: decision)
///     }
///
///     func didRecordTransition(from: String, to: String, action: Action, duration: TimeInterval) {
///         // Monitor performance
///         PerformanceMonitor.record(transition: action, duration: duration)
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    ///   - fingerprint: The unique fingerprint of the newly discovered screen
    ///   - hierarchy: The captured hierarchy of the new screen
    /// - Note: Use this to run accessibility scans, capture screenshots, or log screen info

    ///   - fromFingerprint: Source screen fingerprint
    ///   - toFingerprint: Destination screen fingerprint
    ///   - action: The action that caused the transition
    ///   - duration: How long the transition took

    /// Called when the crawler detects it's stuck on the same screen
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - attemptCount: Number of failed attempts on this screen
    ///   - screenFingerprint: The fingerprint of the screen where crawler is stuck
    /// - Note: Use this to log stuck situations, take debugging screenshots, or trigger manual intervention
